**Project Title:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Healthcare Question Answering  
**Author:** Saif, Abdul  
**Institution:** Penn State University  

---

## üìò Overview
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for healthcare question answering using *The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine* as the core knowledge base.  
The chatbot combines **document retrieval** and **large language model generation** to provide reliable, context-aware, and verifiable answers to user medical queries.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how **RAG architectures** can enhance factual accuracy and explainability in medical conversational systems by grounding responses in trusted data sources.

## üß© System Architecture
### 1. Document Preprocessing  
- Articles from *The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine* are converted into clean text.  
- Text is segmented into chunks for embedding and retrieval.  

### 2. Vector Database Creation  
- Sentence embeddings are generated using transformer models such as  
  `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.  
- Embeddings are stored in a **vector database** (FAISS / Chroma / Pinecone).  

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation  
- On each user query:
  1. The retriever fetches top-k relevant text chunks using cosine similarity.  
  2. Retrieved content is passed to an LLM (e.g., GPT-based model) for contextual generation.  
  3. The LLM produces a natural-language, reference-based answer.
